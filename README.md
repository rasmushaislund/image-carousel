# image-carousel
Simple image carousel with some neat features such as automatic creation of navigation dots based on the number of images in the album and showing of image credits with each image, with data being grapped from an array of objects. Also, upon load, the width of the image showcasing <code>div</code> adjusts dynamically to the client width of the first image in the album.
